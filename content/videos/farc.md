For this project, I worked on material provided by the client. It included footage and a transcription of the interview: text in Spanish and Polish. Ultimately, the interview was to be ready for publication on YouTube with embedded subtitles in Polish.

The transcription contained only the initial time signatures for each of the statements. For this reason, additional work was required to break down the long statements into shorter ones that could be displayed as subtitles.

I used the subtitle generator built into Premiere Pro to generate subtitles in Spanish. I exported these subtitles and translated them into English and then into Polish.

In the next step, I imported the subtitles into the project and verified their correctness step by step based on the provided transcription. This saved the time needed to create each frame of subtitles separately. In addition, I verified the translation of specialised political and military terms to ensure factual accuracy.

Despite the short deadline, using my knowledge of internet searches, I was able to find material depicting the events described by the interview protagonist and use it as b-roll. Finally, using Adobe Photoshop, I created a thumbnail using a frame from the video provided and material available in the public domain.

The whole project took me about 7 hours to complete. You can see the result [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M6GHoN6Otg0).
